# Welcome to the hackwestern repository! 
# Our idea was essentially to create a tool that can analyze medical articles/journals and pull out scales that were used in various studies to make research easier for users!
# Here you can find the code to the tool that was used at the hackathon.
# If you go to the wiki section of my repository, you can see the link to the Figma mock up that was created!
